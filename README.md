## AI-timeline-geomap: A framework that allows for the flexible construction of time-space information displays.

We designed and built **AI-timeline-geomap** because we believe that presenting information through coupled space-time can significantly enhance the effectiveness of information delivery. This applies to various types of content, such as news, history, personal travel logs, business research, and knowledge integration, allowing macro and structural information to be conveyed to users immediately. Adhering to this philosophy, we are not fixated on promoting existing UI components; the component demos provided are merely illustrative. Therefore, the spatiotemporal components in the code can be flexibly replaced or developed according to needs. The multimedia components built on top of timelines and maps can also be flexibly interchanged.

In our demo, we utilized modern AI technologies such as RAG to construct spatiotemporal information. Building a more powerful and comprehensive AI suite to better adapt to the spatiotemporal system is a key goal for the future. This will be pursued after the frontend code is relatively mature. We also hope to collaborate with excellent developers on this endeavor.

## 📰 News
- **[2024.11.15]** An editable time-space map of historical figures has been released. You can use AI capabilities (we have set up the coze intelligent agent) to create time-space maps of characters you are interested in. We welcome you to try it out and join the discussion group for the time-space map of historical figures!
- **[2024.09.29]** The mobile-responsive design has been initially adapted. Please try the demo. Looking forward to your suggestions for improving the design of mobile styles!
